# monte-scala
Tools for the development of Monte Carlo algorithms in Scala, including pure Monte Carlo, Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC).

**This library is under development - it is not yet ready for general use**

In the meantime, take a look at [my blog](https://darrenjw.wordpress.com/), my [Scala course](https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-course/blob/master/README.md) or my [scala-glm](https://github.com/darrenjw/scala-glm/blob/master/README.md) library for basic regression modelling in Scala.
